				<p>At Tabibi Law Firm, we help injured people take back control of their lives after serious accidents.
					We are a Los Angeles personal injury law firm serving clients across California who are dealing with
					pain, stress, lost income, and medical bills after a car accident or other serious injury.</p>
				<p>We do not represent insurance companies or corporations. We represent real people who are hurt,
					overwhelmed, and looking for someone they can trust. Whether your case involves a car crash,
					motorcycle accident, rideshare collision, or a slip and fall, our team is here to guide you through
					it and protect your rights every step of the way.</p>
				<p>If you have been injured, you may not know what to do next. You might be without health insurance,
					unsure how to get treatment, and already feeling pressure from the insurance company. This is where
					we step in. We connect you with medical providers so you can start treatment immediately without
					paying anything out of pocket. We take over all communication with the insurance companies so you
					can focus on healing. And we build a strong case to help you recover the maximum compensation for
					your injuries, time off work, and everything you have been through.</p>
				<p>We treat every client like family. That means we listen, we check in, and we always keep you
					informed. At our firm, communication is a priority. You will never feel ignored or left in the dark.

					you to feel cared for and confident that your case is in the right hands.
					When you call Tabibi Law Firm, you speak directly with an experienced attorney who will explain
					everything clearly and help you understand your options. There are no consultation fees. You do not
					pay anything upfront. And we only get paid when we win your case.</p>

						<p class="card-text pt-2">I was with another law firm and everything was taking too long. I
							switched to Tabibi Law Firm because the attorney has over 30 years of experience and after a
							couple of months I got a check for six figures. This is life changing for me. I couldn’t be
							happier with them. If you or anyone you know has been in a car accident trust me you need to
							hire Tabibi Law Firm. I am still in shock I can’t believe they got me all this money. Mr.
							Tabibi literally changed my life and I will always be so thankful to them. Thank you thank
							you thank you to everyone!</p>

						<p class="card-text pt-2">I hired Tabibi Law Firm after being injured in a car accident in
							California and I’m extremely glad I did. I had never worked with a personal injury lawyer
							before and had no idea how a car accident claim worked or how to deal with the insurance
							company. Tabibi Law Firm handled everything for me and explained the process in a simple way
							that actually made sense.</p>
						<p class="card-text">What really sets Tabibi Law Firm apart from other California personal
							injury law firms is the communication. My attorneys and personal case managers spoke with me
							almost every day and kept me updated on my car accident case so I was never left wondering
							what was happening. The insurance company tried to minimize my injuries and push a low
							settlement but Tabibi Law Firm knew exactly how to respond and protect my rights as an
							injured victim.</p>

						<p class="card-text pt-2">I was recently in a car accident in Orange County and had no idea what
							to do. I was injured, couldn’t go back to work right away, and the stress of dealing with
							the insurance company was starting to get overwhelming. I searched online for a personal
							injury attorney near me and came across Tabibi Law Firm. I decided to call and thankfully it
							was one of the best decisions I could have made.</p>
						<p class="card-text">In the end, I received a settlement that covered my medical bills, time off
							work, and much more than I expected. Most importantly, I felt supported the entire time. If
							you’re looking for a skilled and trustworthy law firm in Orange County who will fight for
							your case and actually care about your recovery, I highly recommend Tabibi Law Firm.</p>
